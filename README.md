# Fuel Consumption Estimation of Vehicles

In this project, we will code a program that can predict fuel consumption of vehicles using the Auto MPG Data Set from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. You can get the original dataset and more information about it from the below link. Also, you can download the dataset from this repository. For the code and detailed information about the project, you can take a look at the file of "fuel_consumption_estimation_of_vehicles.ipynb". We will follow the path below during the project.
